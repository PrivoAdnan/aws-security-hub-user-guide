# Viewing a cross\-Region summary of findings by severity<a name="findings-view-summary"></a>

On the **Summary** page, **Findings by Region** summarizes the number of active findings for each severity across Regions\. The counts only include findings that have a workflow status of `NEW` or `NOTIFIED`\.

Before you enable cross\-Region aggregation, **Findings by Region** only summarizes the findings for the current Region\. It provides a link to configure cross\-Region aggregation\.

After you enable cross\-Region aggregation, **Findings by Region** only displays in the aggregation Region\. It does not display in linked Regions\. The panel summarizes the findings for all of the linked Regions\.

By default, the list only displays linked Regions that have matching findings\. To display all of the linked Regions, including linked Regions that don't have matching findings, choose **All linked Regions**\. To only display linked Regions that have matching findings, choose **Linked Regions with findings**\.

When you choose a severity value for a Region, the **Findings** list is displayed\. The list is filtered by the selected Region and severity\. The list also is filtered to display active findings that have a workflow status of `NEW` or `NOTIFIED`\.
