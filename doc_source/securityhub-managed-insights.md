# Managed insights<a name="securityhub-managed-insights"></a>

AWS Security Hub provides several managed insights\.

You cannot edit or delete Security Hub managed insights\. You can [view and take action on the insight results and findings](securityhub-insights-view-take-action.md)\. You can also [use a managed insight as the basis for a new custom insight](securityhub-custom-insights.md#securityhub-custom-insight-frrom-managed)\.

As with all insights, a managed insight only returns results if you have enabled product integrations or security standards that can produce matching findings\.

For insights that are grouped by resource identifier, the results include the identifiers of all of the resources in the matching findings\. This includes resources that have a different type from the resource type in the filter criteria\. For example, insight 2 identifies findings that are associated with S3 buckets\. If a matching finding contains both an S3 bucket resource and an IAM access key resource, then the insight results include both resources\.

In the current release, Security Hub offers the following managed insights:
