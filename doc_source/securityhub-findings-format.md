# AWS Security Finding Format \(ASFF\)<a name="securityhub-findings-format"></a>

AWS Security Hub consumes, aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes findings from AWS security services and from the third\-party product integrations\. Security Hub processes these findings using a standard findings format called the AWS Security Finding Format \(ASFF\), which eliminates the need for time\-consuming data conversion efforts\. Then it correlates ingested findings across products to prioritize the most important ones\.
