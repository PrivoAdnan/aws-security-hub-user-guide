# Disassociating from your administrator account<a name="securityhub-disassociate-from-admin"></a>

If your account was added as a member account by invitation, you can disassociate the member account from the administrator account\. Once you disassociate a member account, Security Hub doesn't send findings from the account to the administrator account\. Member accounts that are managed using Organizations cannot disassociate their accounts from the administrator account\.

When you disassociate from your administrator account, your account remains in the administrator account's member list with a status of **Resigned**\. However, the administrator account does not receive any findings for your account\.

After you disassociate yourself from the administrator account, you can accept the invitation again\.

  aws securityhub disassociate-from-administrator-account

**Note**  
The Security Hub console continues to use `DisassociateFromMasterAccount`\. It will eventually change to use `DisassociateFromAdministratorAccount`\. Any IAM policies that specifically control access to this function must continue to use `DisassociateFromMasterAccount`\. You should also add `DisassociateFromAdministratorAccount` to your policies to ensure that the correct permissions are in place after the console begins to use `DisassociateFromAdministratorAccount`\.
