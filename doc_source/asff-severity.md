# Severity<a name="asff-severity"></a>

Details about the severity of the finding\.

For [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html) requests, finding providers should use the `Severity` object under [`FindingProviderFields`](asff-findingproviderfields.md)\.

The finding severity does not consider the criticality of the involved assets or the underlying resource\. Criticality is defined as the level of importance of the resources that are associated with the finding\. For example, a resource that is associated with a mission critical application versus one that is associated with nonproduction testing\. To capture information about resource criticality, use the `Criticality` field\.

The finding must have either `Label` or `Normalized` populated\. `Label` is the preferred attribute\. Security Hub populates `Normalized`, but does not otherwise use it\. If neither attribute is populated, then the finding is invalid\.

To view descriptions of `Severity` attributes, see [Severity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_Severity.html) in the *AWS Security Hub API Reference*\.

## Guidance for assigning severity \(AWS services and partners\)<a name="asff-severity-guidance"></a>

For findings generated by AWS services and third\-party partner products, the severity is based on the following\.
+ **Most severe** – Findings that are associated with actual data loss or denial of service
+ **Second\-most severe** – Findings that are associated with an active compromise but that do not indicate that data loss or other negative effects have occurred
+ **Third\-most severe** – Findings that are associated with issues that indicate potential for a future compromise

We recommend that you use the following guidance when translating findings' native severity scores to the value of ` Severity.Label` for the ASFF\.
+ Informational findings\. This category may include a finding for a `PASSED`, `WARNING`, or `NOT AVAILABLE` check or a sensitive data identification\.

  Suggested severity: `INFORMATIONAL`
+ Findings that are associated with issues that could result in future compromises\. For example, this category may include vulnerabilities, configuration weaknesses, and exposed passwords\.

  This generally aligns to the `Software and Configuration Checks` namespace under a finding's type\.

  Suggested severity: `LOW`
+ Findings that are associated with issues that indicate an active compromise, but no indication that an adversary completed their objectives\. For example, this category may include malware activity, hacking activity, and unusual behavior detection\.

  This generally aligns to the `Threat Detections and Unusual Behavior` namespaces under a finding's type\.

  Suggested severity: `MEDIUM`
+ Findings that indicate that an adversary completed their objectives, such as active data loss or compromise or a denial of service\.

  This generally aligns to the `Effects` namespace under a finding's type\.

  Suggested severity: `HIGH` or `CRITICAL`

## How Security Hub maps Label and Normalized values<a name="asff-severity-map-normalized-label"></a>

If a [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html) request for a new finding only provides `Label` or only provides `Normalized`, then Security Hub automatically populates the value of the other field\.

`Label` is the preferred attribute\. Security Hub populates `Normalized`, but does not otherwise use it\.

Security Hub does not make any automatic updates based on changes from [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html)\.

If [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html) provides `Normalized` and does not provide `Label`, `Label` is set automatically as follows\.


|  Normalized  |  Label  | 
| --- | --- | 
|  0  |  `INFORMATIONAL`  | 
|  1–39  |  `LOW`  | 
|  40–69  |  `MEDIUM`  | 
|  70–89  |  `HIGH`  | 
|  90–100  |  `CRITICAL`  | 

If [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html) only provides `Label` and does not provide `Normalized`, `Normalized` is set automatically as follows\.


|  Label  |  Normalized  | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `INFORMATIONAL`  |  0  | 
|  `LOW`  |  1  | 
|  `MEDIUM`  |  40  | 
|  `HIGH`  |  70  | 
|  `CRITICAL`  |  90  |
