# Determining the security score for a security standard<a name="standards-security-score"></a>

On the **Security standards** page, each enabled standard displays a security score from 0â€“100%\. The standard details page also displays the overall security score\.

Security Hub updates the calculated security score every 24 hours\. Security Hub displays a timestamp to indicate when the current security score was last updated\.

When the standard is first enabled, Security Hub cannot calculate the initial security score until the standard status is `READY`\. The initial security score is available within 24 hours after that\. To see the current status of the standard, use the `GetEnabledStandards` API operation\.

## How the security score is calculated<a name="standard-security-score-calculation"></a>

The security score represents the proportion of **Passed** controls to enabled controls\. The score is displayed as a percentage\. For example, if 10 controls are enabled for a standard, and seven of those controls are in a **Passed** state, then the security score is 70%\.

The security score only reflects enabled controls and control findings from the current Region\. It does not support finding aggregation\.

The security score calculation omits enabled controls that do not have any findings \(overall status is **No data**\)\. For example, a standard has 12 controls enabled\. Six of those controls are in a **Passed** state\. Two controls have no data\. Because the calculation omits the controls without data, the security score is 60%\.

## Security score for administrator accounts<a name="standard-security-score-admin"></a>

For the administrator account, the security score for a standard is an aggregated score across both the administrator account and all of the member accounts\.

## Security scores on the Summary page<a name="standard-security-score-summary-page"></a>

On the **Summary** page, the **Security standards** card displays the security scores for each enabled standard\. It also displays a consolidated security score that represents the proportion of passed controls to enabled controls across all of the enabled standards\.
