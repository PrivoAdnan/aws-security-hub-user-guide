# Required attributes<a name="asff-required-attributes"></a>

The following attributes are required for all findings in Security Hub\. For more information about these required attributes, see [AwsSecurityFinding](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_AwsSecurityFinding.html) in the *AWS Security Hub API Reference*\.

## AwsAccountId<a name="AwsAccountId"></a>

The AWS account ID that the finding applies to\.

**Example**

```
"AwsAccountId": "111111111111"
```

## CreatedAt<a name="CreatedAt"></a>

Indicates when the potential security issue captured by a finding was created\.

**Example**

```
"CreatedAt": "2017-03-22T13:22:13.933Z"
```

**Note**  
Security Hub deletes findings 90 days after the most recent update or 90 days after the creation date if no update occurs\. To store findings for longer than 90 days, you can configure a rule in Amazon EventBridge that routes findings to your S3 bucket\.

## Description<a name="Description"></a>

A finding's description\. This field can be nonspecific boilerplate text or details that are specific to the instance of the finding\.

For control findings that Security Hub generates, this field provides a description of the control\.

This field doesn't reference a standard if you turn on [consolidated control findings](controls-findings-create-update.md#consolidated-control-findings)\.

**Example**

```
"Description": "This AWS control checks whether AWS Config is enabled in the current account and Region."
```

## GeneratorId<a name="GeneratorId"></a>

The identifier for the solution\-specific component \(a discrete unit of logic\) that generated a finding\.

For control findings that Security Hub generates, this field doesn't reference a standard if you turn on [consolidated control findings](controls-findings-create-update.md#consolidated-control-findings)\.

**Example**

```
"GeneratorId": "security-control/Config.1"
```

## Id<a name="Id"></a>

The product\-specific identifier for a finding\. For control findings that Security Hub generates, this field provides the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the finding\.

This field doesn't reference a standard if you turn on [consolidated control findings](controls-findings-create-update.md#consolidated-control-findings)\.

**Example**

```
"Id": "arn:aws:securityhub:eu-central-1:123456789012:security-control/iam.9/finding/ab6d6a26-a156-48f0-9403-115983e5a956

"
```

## ProductArn<a name="ProductArn"></a>

The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) generated by Security Hub that uniquely identifies a third\-party findings product after the product is registered with Security Hub\.

The format of this field is `arn:partition:securityhub:region:account-id:product/company-id/product-id`\.
+ For AWS services that are integrated with Security Hub, the `company-id` must be "`aws`", and the `product-id` must be the AWS public service name\. Because AWS products and services aren't associated with an account, the `account-id` section of the ARN is empty\. AWS services that are not yet integrated with Security Hub are considered third\-party products\.
+ For public products, the `company-id` and `product-id` must be the ID values specified at the time of registration\.
+ For private products, the `company-id` must be the account ID\. The `product-id` must be the reserved word "default" or the ID that was specified at the time of registration\.

**Example**

```
// Private ARN
    "ProductArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-east-1:111111111111:product/111111111111/default"

// Public ARN

    "ProductArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-2::product/aws/guardduty"
    "ProductArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-2:222222222222:product/generico/secure-pro"
```

## Resources<a name="Resources"></a>

The [`Resources`](asff-resources.md) object provides a set of resource data types that describe the AWS resources that the finding refers to\.

**Example**

```
"Resources": [
 	{
	"Type": "AwsEc2Instance",
	"Id": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:111122223333:instance/i-1234567890abcdef0",
	"Partition": "aws",
	"Region": "us-west-2",
	"ResourceRole": "Target",
	"Tags": {
		"billingCode": "Lotus-1-2-3",
		"needsPatching": true
	},
	"Details": {
		"IamInstanceProfileArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/IamInstanceProfileArn",
		"ImageId": "ami-79fd7eee",
		"IpV4Addresses": ["1.1.1.1"],
		"IpV6Addresses": ["2001:db8:1234:1a2b::123"],
		"KeyName": "testkey",
		"LaunchedAt": "2018-09-29T01:25:54Z",
		"MetadataOptions": {
			"HttpEndpoint": "enabled",
			"HttpProtocolIpv6": "enabled",
			"HttpPutResponseHopLimit": 1,
			"HttpTokens": "optional",
			"InstanceMetadataTags": "disabled"
		}
	},
		"NetworkInterfaces": [
		{
			"NetworkInterfaceId": "eni-e5aa89a3"
		}
		],
		"SubnetId": "PublicSubnet",
		"Type": "i3.xlarge",
		"VirtualizationType": "hvm",
		"VpcId": "TestVPCIpv6"
	}

]
```

## SchemaVersion<a name="SchemaVersion"></a>

The schema version that a finding is formatted for\. The value of this field must be one of the officially published versions identified by AWS\. In the current release, the AWS Security Finding Format schema version is `2018-10-08`\.

**Example**

```
"SchemaVersion": "2018-10-08"
```

## Severity<a name="Severity"></a>

Defines the importance of a finding\. For details about this object, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_Severity.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_Severity.html) in the *AWS Security Hub API Reference*\.

To designate severity, the finding must have either the `Label` or `Normalized` field populated\. `Label` is the preferred attribute\. If neither attribute is populated, then the finding is not valid\.

To provide severity information, finding providers should use the `Severity` object under `FindingProviderFields` when making a [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html) API request\. If a `BatchImportFindings` request for a new finding only provides ` Label` or only provides `Normalized`, then Security Hub automatically populates the value of the other field\.

The value of the `Severity` object for a finding should only be updated by the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html) API operation\.

The finding severity does not consider the criticality of the involved assets or the underlying resource\. Criticality is defined as the level of importance of the resources that are associated with the finding\. For example, a resource that is associated with a mission critical application has higher criticality than one that is associated with nonproduction testing\. To capture information about resource criticality, use the `Criticality` field\.

We recommend using the following guidance when translating findings' native severity scores to the value of `Severity.Label` in the ASFF\.
+ `INFORMATIONAL` – This category may include a finding for a `PASSED`, `WARNING`, or `NOT AVAILABLE` check or a sensitive data identification\.
+ `LOW` – Findings that could result in future compromises\. For example, this category may include vulnerabilities, configuration weaknesses, and exposed passwords\.
+ `MEDIUM` – Findings that indicate an active compromise, but no indication that an adversary completed their objectives\. For example, this category may include malware activity, hacking activity, and unusual behavior detection\.
+ `HIGH` or `CRITICAL` – Findings that indicate that an adversary completed their objectives, such as active data loss or compromise or a denial of service\.

**Example**

```
"Severity": {
    "Label": "CRITICAL",
    "Normalized": 90,
    "Original": "CRITICAL"
}
```

## Title<a name="Title"></a>

A finding's title\. This field can contain nonspecific boilerplate text or details that are specific to this instance of the finding\.

For control findings, this field provides the title of the control\.

This field doesn't reference a standard if you turn on [consolidated control findings](controls-findings-create-update.md#consolidated-control-findings)\.

**Example**

```
"Title": "AWS Config should be enabled"
```

## Types<a name="Types"></a>

One or more finding types in the format of `namespace/category/classifier` that classify a finding\. For a list of namespaces, classifier, and categories, see [Types taxonomy for ASFF](securityhub-findings-format-type-taxonomy.md)\.

`Types` should only be updated using [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html)\.

Finding providers who want to provide a value for `Types` should use the `Types` attribute under [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_FindingProviderFields.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_FindingProviderFields.html)\.

This field doesn't reference a standard if you turn on [consolidated control findings](controls-findings-create-update.md#consolidated-control-findings)\.

**Example**

```
"Types": [
    "Software and Configuration Checks/Vulnerabilities/CVE"
				]
```

## UpdatedAt<a name="UpdatedAt"></a>

Indicates when the finding provider last updated the finding record\.

This timestamp reflects the time when the finding record was last or most recently updated\. Consequently, it can differ from the `LastObservedAt` timestamp, which reflects when the event or vulnerability was last or most recently observed\.

When you update the finding record, you must update this timestamp to the current timestamp\. Upon creation of a finding record, the `CreatedAt` and `UpdatedAt` timestamps must be the same\. After an update to the finding record, the value of this field must be more recent than all of the previous values that it contained\.

Note that `UpdatedAt` cannot be updated by using the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html) API operation\. You can only update it by using [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html)\.

**Example**

```
"UpdatedAt": "2017-04-22T13:22:13.933Z"
```

**Note**  
Security Hub deletes findings 90 days after the most recent update or 90 days after the creation date if no update occurs\. To store findings for longer than 90 days, you can configure a rule in Amazon EventBridge that routes findings to your S3 bucket\.
