# Viewing and managing security controls<a name="controls-view-manage"></a>

A control is a safeguard within a security standard that helps an organization protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information\. In Security Hub, a control is related to a specific AWS resource\.

## Consolidated controls view<a name="consolidated-controls-view"></a>

Consolidated controls view displays all your controls across standards on the **Controls** page of the Security Hub console \(you can view controls in the context of a standard by visiting the **Security standards** page and choosing a standard\)\. Security Hub assigns controls a consistent security control ID, title, and description across standards\. Controls IDs include the relevant AWS service and a unique number \(for example, CodeBuild\.3\)\.

**Note**  
Consolidated controls view isn't currently supported in the AWS GovCloud \(US\) Region and China Regions\. Control IDs, titles, and other ASFF fields remain the same in these Regions and may reference specific standards\. For a list of control IDs and titles in these Regions, see the second and third columns in [How consolidation impacts control IDs and titles](asff-changes-consolidation.md#securityhub-findings-format-changes-ids-titles)\.

The following information is available on the **Controls** page of the [Security Hub console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/)\.
+ An overall security score based on the proportion of passed controls compared to the total number of enabled controls with data
+ The percentage of failed security checks across all enabled controls
+ The number of passed and failed security checks for controls of varying severity
+ A list of controls divided into different tabs based on enablement status and the overall status of enabled controls

From the **Controls** page, you can choose a control to view its details and take action on the findings generated by the control\. From this page, you can also enable or disable a security control in your current AWS account and AWS Region\. Enablement and disablement actions from the **Controls** page apply across standards\. For more information, see [Enabling and disabling controls in all standards](securityhub-standards-enable-disable-controls.md)\.

For administrator accounts, the **Controls** page reflects the status of controls across the member accounts\. If a control check fails in at least one member account, the control appears in the **Failed** tab of the **Controls** page\. If you have set an [aggregation Region](finding-aggregation.md), the **Controls** page reflects the status of controls across all linked Regions\. If a control check fails in at least one linked Region, the control appears in the **Failed** tab of the **Controls** page\.

Consolidated controls view causes changes to control finding fields in the AWS Security Finding Format \(ASFF\) that may affect workflows\. For more information, see [Consolidated controls view – ASFF changes](asff-changes-consolidation.md#securityhub-findings-format-consolidated-controls-view)\.

## Overall security score for controls<a name="controls-overall-score"></a>

The **Controls** page displays an overall security score from 0–100 percent\. The overall security score is calculated based on the proportion of passed controls compared to the total number of enabled controls with data\.

**Note**  
 To view the overall security score for controls, you must add permission to call **`BatchGetControlEvaluations`** to the IAM role that you use to access Security Hub\. This permission isn't required to view security scores for specific standards\. 

When you enable Security Hub, Security Hub calculates the initial security score within 30 minutes after your first visit to the **Summary** page or **Security standards** page on the Security Hub console\. It can take up to 24 hours for first\-time security scores to be generated in the China Regions and AWS GovCloud \(US\) Region\. Scores are only generated for standards that are enabled when you visit those pages\. To view a list of standards that are currently enabled, use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_GetEnabledStandards.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_GetEnabledStandards.html) API operation\. In addition, AWS Config resource recording must be configured for scores to appear\. The overall security score is the average of the [standard security scores](standards-security-score.md)\.

After first\-time score generation, Security Hub updates security scores every 24 hours\. Security Hub displays a timestamp to indicate when a security score was last updated\.

If you have set an [aggregation Region](finding-aggregation.md), the overall security score reflects control findings across linked Regions\.
